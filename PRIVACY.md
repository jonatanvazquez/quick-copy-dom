# Privacy Policy for Quick Copy DOM

**Last updated: January 2025**

## Overview

Quick Copy DOM is committed to protecting your privacy. This privacy policy explains what information (if any) our extension collects and how it's used.

## Data Collection

**Quick Copy DOM does NOT collect, store, or transmit any user data.**

Specifically, we do NOT:
- Collect personal information
- Track your browsing history
- Store any data about the websites you visit
- Send any information to external servers
- Use analytics or tracking tools
- Access your data until you explicitly activate the extension

## How the Extension Works

Quick Copy DOM operates entirely within your browser:

1. When you activate the extension (by clicking the icon or using the keyboard shortcut), it injects a small script into the current page
2. This script highlights elements as you hover over them
3. When you click an element, its HTML is copied to your local clipboard
4. No data leaves your browser at any point

## Permissions Explained

| Permission | Why We Need It |
|------------|----------------|
| `activeTab` | To interact with the current page when you activate the extension. This permission only grants access to the tab you're actively using. |
| `scripting` | To inject the element selection functionality into the page. This only happens when you explicitly activate the extension. |

## Third-Party Services

Quick Copy DOM does not use any third-party services, APIs, or analytics.

## Data Storage

Quick Copy DOM does not store any data locally or remotely. Each time you use the extension, it operates in memory only and leaves no trace after you close the page.

## Changes to This Policy

If we make changes to this privacy policy, we will update the "Last updated" date at the top of this document.

## Contact

If you have questions about this privacy policy, please open an issue on our GitHub repository.

## Summary

**Your privacy is guaranteed.** Quick Copy DOM is a simple, local-only tool that helps you copy HTML elements. It has no tracking, no data collection, and no external communications.
